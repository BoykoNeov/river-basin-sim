# CLAUDE.md — River Basin Simulator

Project conventions for Claude Code. **`HANDOFF.md` is the source of truth** for
architecture, the locked decisions, the numerics spec, the component contracts,
and the milestone build order. Read it before non-trivial work; this file only
adds conventions and records what's easy to get wrong.

## What this is
A batch (not real-time) GPU shallow-water river-basin simulator. Three components
connected by **files, not code** (HANDOFF §4): a Python+Warp solver, an offline
data-prep pipeline, and a Godot 4 viewer. The seam is a contract (§7) — either
side can be rewritten as long as the formats hold.

A faithful research/education sandbox validated against benchmarks — **not a
regulatory-certification tool**. State that honestly anywhere it matters.

## Status
- **M1 — Water moves: acceptance met; confirm before M2.** Local-inertial (Bates
  2010) shallow-water solver in Warp on the staggered raster: uniform rainfall,
  closed BCs, deterministic state-derived Δt, canonical Zarr out (§7.2), live
  float64/Kahan mass balance. **Dam-break validated** (wet-bed Stoker enforced:
  mass 2.5e-9, nRMSE 0.074; dry-bed Ritter diagnostic). The real M0 Smoky Mtns
  tile is steep — LI's worst case — so M1 also has a **mass-conservative per-cell
  flux limiter** (donor-cell β scaling) that keeps depths non-negative out of
  regime; the demo runs stably (mass 2.1e-8, mean depth = rain input). Note: on
  the steep tile mass + spatial pattern are sound, but steep-cell velocities are
  limiter-shaped, **not** validated LI hydraulics — don't carry that as a fidelity
  claim into M2. Runs are bitwise-deterministic (verified). 18 tests green on Warp
  CPU backend. See `docs/plans/M1-water-moves.md`.
- **M0 — Foundation: done.** SRTM `N35W083` → conditioned (UTM 17N, sink-fill, D8
  flow dir/accum) → `.r32` tile → static 3D terrain in Godot via Terrain3D
  (Godot 4.7). Tooling locked: **pysheds** (NumPy-2.x `np.in1d` shim in
  `pipeline/_compat.py`) and **Terrain3D**. See `docs/plans/M0-foundation.md`.
- Milestones M0–M7: `docs/plans/roadmap.md`.

## Commands
- `uv sync` — create/refresh the venv (installs deps + `dev` group).
- `uv sync --extra geo` — also installs the offline DEM-conditioning stack
  (rasterio, pyproj, pysheds). **Needed for the pipeline tests** — without it the 5
  `pipeline/test_pipeline.py` tests `importorskip` and silently skip (still "green").
- `uv run python scripts/smoke_test.py` — toolchain self-check (GPU + Zarr).
- `uv run ruff check .` / `uv run ruff format .` — lint / format.
- `uv run pytest` — tests + validation harness (runs on Warp's **CPU** backend, so
  it works in CI without a GPU). Run after `uv sync --extra geo` to exercise the pipeline.
- Pipeline (M0): `uv run python -m pipeline.condition --src <dem> --out <dir>` then
  `uv run python -m pipeline.tile --src <dir> --out data/tiles/demo --single`.
- Solver (M1): `uv run python -m solver.run` runs the demo (uniform rain on the M0
  tile → `data/results/demo.zarr`); `--tiles`, `--out`, `--end-time`,
  `--output-every`, `--rain-mm-hr`, `--device` override the in-code scenario. The
  §7.1 `--config <toml>` interface arrives with M2.

## Conventions
- **Package manager: `uv`** (not pip/venv). Python pinned to **3.13** via
  `.python-version`. Add deps with `uv add`, dev deps with `uv add --dev`.
- **Commits: Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`,
  `refactor:`, `test:`). Each commit should pass `ruff` + `pytest`. Scope by
  component where useful (`feat(solver): ...`).
- **Plan before code** for any milestone-sized work; capture the plan in
  `docs/plans/`. Stop at each milestone's demo and confirm before the next
  (HANDOFF §9, §13).
- **Numerics invariants (HANDOFF §8):** float32 GPU fields, but the global
  mass-balance accumulator is **float64 / Kahan**. Adaptive `Δt` derives from
  **state, never wall-clock** (determinism). The mass-balance relative error is a
  hard validation gate — exceedance is a failing test, not a warning.
- **The decoupling contract is sacred (§7):** the solver only ever *writes* files
  (Zarr, per-frame tiles, status.json); the viewer only ever *reads* them. No
  shared memory, no shared process.

## Gotchas (what's easy to get wrong here)
- **`richdem` is dead** — no wheels past cp37, won't build on modern Python. Use
  **pysheds** (or WhiteboxTools) for sink-fill / flow direction / flow accumulation.
- **pysheds 0.5 is stale** (classifiers stop at 3.9). It installs as pure-Python on
  top of numba, but verify it actually *runs* on 3.13 + current numba before
  building M0's pipeline on it; WhiteboxTools is the no-Python-coupling fallback.
- **Windows console encoding:** keep script `print()` output ASCII (no em-dashes) —
  the default code page mangles unicode and clutters logs.
- **Warp JIT cache** lives under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\warp\Cache`, not the repo;
  first kernel launch pays a ~0.7 s compile, then it's cached.
- **Don't reintroduce real-time** as a primary mode, cross-vendor GPU support, or
  certification-grade accuracy claims (HANDOFF §3, non-goals).
